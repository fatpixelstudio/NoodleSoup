# NoodleSoup

Front-end starter kit by Fat Pixel.

This repository is under heavy construction.

A collection of scripts, styles and a yarn / webpack bundler for your projects.

Some PHP files that you can use for reference how to call the different assets. You could also use this as a drop-in starterkit.

Want to use this with Wordpress? Lose the PHP and use my Wordpress starter kit [StickyRice](https://github.com/fatpixelstudio/StickyRice)!
