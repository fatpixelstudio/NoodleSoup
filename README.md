# NoodleSoup
================

Front-end starter kit by Fat Pixel.

This repository is under heavy construction. It will be a bare-bones starter kit for flat HTML and PHP projects. No styling and scripting, just the code.

## Why NoodleSoup?

I know. It's a silly name. If you really need to know the reason why such a silly name for a front-end starter kit, here goes. The name of my one-man web studio is Fat Pixel. I figured the starter kit should be something dinner related. So because it's a 'starter', let's give it the name of an entree. And also because of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJuWdyq0ETA). So there's that: Noodle Soup. A silly name.
